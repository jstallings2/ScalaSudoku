Java vs. Scala

- Scala uses () instead of [] for array indexing

- Function parameters are like (row: Int) instead of (int row)

- Scala infers types. Use var for variables and val instead for anything you would make const

- "Unit =" is the same as saying "void"

- for loop : for(i <- 0 until 10) will go from 0 to 9 (if you want to do a 10th loop, use "to" instead of "until"




Steps

1. For now, Intialize a hard-coded board (working)

2. Load board from file (see loadFromFile, almost there)

3. Display board (mostly to make sure initalizing the board works)

4. Row, column, and subsquare checks

5. Solver
