# Project 4
## CS 3270: Programming Languages
## Team Members
### Taylor Pothast, Jacob Stallings

## Goal

Gain experience in quickly learning a new programming language.

## Project submission

For submission, the individual or team repository for Project 4 on GitHub should contain the following files:

* All source code. Make sure to add block comments to the top of all source files and include an academic honesty statement.
* Two text files containing test puzzles, one that is solvable and one that isn't.
* An image file (GIF, JPG, or PNG) showing a screen shot of your program solving a puzzle.
* Update the `project4.md` file and add the information below.
  * Names of team members.
  * Instructions on how to access an appropriate compiler/interpreter for your solver. Please include a URL and any special installation instructions. You may include installation instructions based on the operating system that you used for the project.
  * Instructions on how to use your solver. Please include, as appropriate, instructions on compiling, linking, and running your solver.
  * A short description of what language feature that you found interesting or helpful.
  * A short description of what you found the language to be lacking of, an aspect of the language that was hard to understand, or a disadvantage that you perceived of the language.

### Program Solving the Puzzle

The `project4.md` file is a *Markdown* file, which allows you to use simple syntax to format the text in the file. You can open and edit `project4.md` in your favorite text editor. You are not required to *beautify* your text in this file, but at the very least, place a header before each of the items listed above. For example, add a header using two or three `#` before the header text:


Please include the screen shot of your program solving a puzzle in `project4.md`. Use the `[text](file name)` markup code to include an image. The resolution of the image should be good enough to be able to read the output of the program. The following example markup code will display the image file named `example-screen-shot.png` that is located in the `images` folder in this repository.
